## Changes to this documentation
Although all modules of the Zetkin project must follow the rules set forth in
this documentation, these documents themselves, like anything in an open-source
project, is open for debate.

If you find something that you believe is incorrect, or if you have another
opinion about best practices than one found in this documentation, you should
submit a pull request to this repository and argue why the documentation (and
hence the rules and guides therein) should be changed.

## Did you find non-conforming code?
If you find a piece of code that you believe do not follow the style described
in this documentation, submit a pull request to the repository containing the
incorrect code, or file an issue report for that repository, referencing the
part of the Contributors Reference that it violates.
